# DUCI: Dataset Usage Cardinality Inference
This repo contains implementation of the paper ***How Much of My Dataset Did You Use? Quantitative Data Usage Inference in Machine Learning***

Thank you for your interest in this project! The code will be uploaded soon.

Additionally, we are glad to share that DUCI is integrated into the PrivacyMeter toolkit, which provides tools for auditing privacy risks in machine learning models. You can explore PrivacyMeter here: [PrivacyMeter](https://github.com/privacytrustlab/ml_privacy_meter).

We appreciate your patience and look forward to sharing more updates with you!
